I added some things:

· A la funció OnTriggerEnter, a HayDestroyer, com només passaran els prefabs de les bullets
no cal ficar un if, per tant només he ficat el Destroy(other.gameObject).

· Hearts that fly away and dissapear after a programmed time when the sheep is shot
by the hay.

· Sounds (hay shot, sheep droping, and sheep shot by hay)

· After that passes 3 sheeps, the game, ends.

· Score: how many sheeps has passed, and how many have you killed.

· A menu, that when you pass the mouse over the Start button or Quit button, it changes de color.

· On the menu, you can choose which HayMachine's color you want (Blue, Red or Yellow).

· And as final thing, over the time the sheeps spawn faster.
